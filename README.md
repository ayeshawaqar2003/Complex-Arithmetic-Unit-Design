# Complex-Arithmetic-Unit-Design
Design and implement a Complex Arithmetic Unit using advanced VLSI techniques, catering to the requirements of high-performance digital systems. 


OBJECTIVE:



The unit is specifically tasked with performing complex multiplication and addition, fundamental operations in various computational and signal processing applications. These operations involve handling inputs represented as a+bia + bia+bi and c+dic + dic+di, where a,b,c,a, b, c,a,b,c, and ddd are 16-bit signed integers. The design's critical requirement is to produce accurate results in a single clock cycle, a challenging constraint that emphasizes the need for a well-structured and efficient architecture.



Arithmetic Operations:


⦁ Complex Multiplication:
(a+bi) ×(c+di) =(ac−bd) +(ad+bc)i(a + bi) \times (c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i(a+bi)×(c+di)=(ac−bd)+(ad+bc)I


Outputs:
y=ac−bdy = ac - bdy=ac−bd, z=ad+bcz = ad + bcz=ad+bc.


⦁ Complex Addition:
(a+bi) +(c+di) =(a+c) +(b+d)i(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i(a+bi)+(c+di)=(a+c)+(b+d)I



Outputs:
w=a+cw = a + cw=a+c, x=b+dx = b + dx=b+d.

Code Implementation:


Verilog Modules:


⦁ Multiplication Module: A pipelined Verilog module was designed to compute yyy and zzz for the complex multiplication operation. This module utilizes a resource-efficient architecture to ensure correct computation within a single clock cycle.
⦁ Addition Module: Another Verilog module was developed for computing www and xxx using basic arithmetic operations, guaranteeing accurate addition of complex numbers.



Testbench:



A comprehensive testbench was implemented to automate the verification process:

⦁ The testbench applied diverse test vectors to ensure complete coverage of input cases.
⦁ Automated comparison logic was integrated to compare actual outputs with expected values, reporting any mismatches for error analysis.



Pipelining Architecture:


⦁ A pipelined design is implemented initially using 4 multipliers for complex multiplication.
⦁ The design is optimized to use 3 multipliers by sharing resources while maintaining throughput and synchronization.



Synchronization:


A valid signal ensures synchronization across pipeline stages, guaranteeing consistent operation within a single clock cycle.
